/*
Create a web page consisting of HTML (register.html), CSS (style.css), and JavaScript (register.js) files that implements a user registration form with form validation.

The web page styling should be close to the following. 
   Note: Specific styles listed in the requirements will be checked using automated tests, but a visual inspection may also be used to check the overall style of the web page.

   The default border for the test, email, and password <input> elements should be 1 pixel, solid, with color #aaa

If there are form validation errors,
   The formErrors <div> should be shown by setting display to block
   Each of the associated error messages should be displayed in the formErrors <div> using an unordered list with red text. The error message must be displayed in the order the validation is performed, following the order specified below.
   Each <input> element with the invalid input should be styled with a 2 pixel, red, solid border.
      Otherwise, the default border should be used (1 pixel, solid, with color #aaa)

If there are no form validation errors,
   The formErrors <div> should not be shown (i.e., the display style should be none)
   All test, email, and password <input> elements should use the default border of 1 pixel, solid, color #aaa
