Project: Weighted Graphs
Author: Chris Walters
Course: CS 2420
Date: 4/29/2021

Description: Weighted graphs show up as a way to represent information in many applications, such as communication networks, water, power and energy systems, mazes, games and any problem where there is a measurable relationship between two or more things. It is therefore important to know how to represent graphs, and to understand important operations and algorithms associated with graphs. For this project, you will implement a directed, weighted graph and associated operations along with breadth-first search and Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithms.

For this project, you will write a Graph ADT and a small main function as a small test driver “application”. Include main() in your graph.py source file with conditional execution.  It is common for modules to include a runnable main() to use for testing purposes.  It happens in this case, you will have both main() AND the test code we give you to test your implementation.

def main():
    """
    1. Construct the graph shown in Figure 1 using your ADT
    2. Print it to the console in GraphViz notation as shown in Figure 1
    3. Print results of DFS starting with vertex “A” as shown in Figure 2
    4. BFS starting with vertex “A” as shown in Figure 3
    5. Print the path from vertex “ A” to vertex “F” (not shown here) using Djikstra’s shortest path algorithm (DSP) as a string like #3 and #4
    6. Print the shortest paths from “A” to each other vertex, one path per line using DSP
